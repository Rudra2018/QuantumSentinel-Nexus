## Security Assessment Highlights

### High-Priority Vulnerabilities to Research:
1. **ML Model Poisoning**: Target ML frameworks for training data manipulation
2. **Serialization Attacks**: Focus on model format libraries (ONNX, SafeTensors)
3. **Memory Safety Issues**: C++ components in PyTorch, TensorFlow
4. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Python packages with extensive dependency trees
5. **Container Escape**: MLOps platforms running in containerized environments

### Recommended Attack Vectors:
1. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Target popular packages with high download counts
2. **Model Inference Attacks**: Adversarial inputs to break inference engines
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to training datasets
4. **Privilege Escalation**: MLOps platform misconfigurations
5. **Code Injection**: Dynamic evaluation in ML frameworks

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize High-Risk ML Frameworks**: Focus on PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Apache Spark
2. **Target MLOps Infrastructure**: MLflow and Airflow present significant opportunities
3. **Focus on Memory-Unsafe Languages**: C++ components have higher vulnerability potential
4. **Investigate Serialization Vulnerabilities**: Model formats are prone to deserialization attacks
5. **Monitor Repository Activity**: Track new releases and security patches

## Next Steps

1. Deploy automated scanning against identified high-priority targets
2. Establish continuous monitoring for new vulnerabilities in target repositories
3. Develop specialized testing workflows for ML/AI systems
4. Create proof-of-concept exploits for identified vulnerability classes
5. Prepare bug bounty submissions with detailed impact analysis
